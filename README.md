AFINCH
AFINCH (Analysis of Flow in Networks of Channels)
========================================================

* AFINCH is a computer application designed to generate time series of monthly flows at stream segments (flowlines) and corresponding water yields at catchments defined in the National Hydrography Dataset (NHDPlus, v. 2).  
* AFINCH provides a basis for integrating monthly flow data from streamgages, water-use data, monthly climatic data, land-cover characteristics defined in NHDPlus, and catchment attributes described in user-defined shapefiles to estimate natural monthly water yields from catchments.
* AFINCH provides an interactive process for the user to develop sets of multiple-regression equations for estimating monthly water yields.  
 * Images of monthly water yields for active streamgages are generated in AFINCH and provide a basis for detecting anomalies in water yields, which may be associated with undocumented flow diversions or augmentations.  
* Water yields are multiplied by the drainage areas of the corresponding catchments to estimate monthly flows.  
* Flows from catchments are accumulated downstream through the streamflow network described by the stream segments.  
 * For stream segments where streamgages are active, ratios of measured to accumulated flows are computed.  
 * These ratios are applied to upstream water yields to proportionally constrain estimated flows to match measured flows.  
* A time series of monthly flows can be generated for stream segments that average about 1-mile long, or monthly water yields from catchments that average about 1 square mile.  
 * Chloropleth maps of monthly water yield and flow can be generated and analyzed.  
 * Estimated monthly flows can be displayed within AFINCH, examined for nonstationarity, and tested for monotonic trends.  
 * Monthly flows also can be used to estimate flow-duration characteristics at stream segments within AFINCH.  
* AFINCH generates output files of monthly flows and water yields that are that can be used for specialized analyses.  
* AFINCH conserves through the NHDPlus network.  
* Matlab code used in the AFINCH application is included in the repository starting with version 3a.
